# GradeBook
This project is a console-based gradebook application built in Java. It allows users to input student details, including their names, IDs, and numerical grades. The program then automatically determines the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) based on predefined cutoff points.

The application continuously prompts the user to enter student data and stores each record in a gradebook. Once the user types “DONE,” the program displays all stored student information, including their scores and letter grades.
